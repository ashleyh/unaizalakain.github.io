[lightweight-motion](https://github.com/unaizalakain/lightweight-motion) is a
``RPY``-ready lightweight motion detection software for USB and HTTP(S)
cameras.

It features both USB and HTTP(S) camera support, outputing events to a
directory, to a HTTP stream and to a window, custom threshold and sensitivity
adjustement and frame number specification for before and after a movement
event starts.

The project is a bit stalled, partly because the reason of developing it no
longer exists and partly because I didn't receive any issue notifications or
pull requests.
