Although most of my projects are available on
[github](https://github.com/unaizalakain/), here are some of them:

- [Django]({{ HOME_PATH }}projects/django/): a web framework for perfectionists
  with deadlines.
- [TPB]({{ HOME_PATH }}projects/tpb/): smooth API for The Pirate Bay.
- [lightweight-motion]({{ HOME_PATH }}projects/lwm/): lightweight RPY-ready
  motion detection for USB and HTTP(S) cameras.
- [django-require]({{ HOME_PATH }}projects/require/): a Django staticfiles
  post-processor for optimizing with RequireJS.
