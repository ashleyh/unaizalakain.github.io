Although most of my work is available on
[github](https://github.com/unaizalakain/) or
[bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/unaizalakain), here are some of the most
meaningful projects I have worked on:

- [Django]({{ HOME_PATH }}projects/django/): a web framework for perfectionists
  with deadlines.
- [TPB]({{ HOME_PATH }}projects/tpb/): smooth API for The Pirate Bay.
- [lightweight-motion]({{ HOME_PATH }}projects/lwm/): lightweight RPY-ready
  motion detection for USB and HTTP(S) cameras.
- [django-require]({{ HOME_PATH }}projects/require/): a Django staticfiles
  post-processor for optimizing with RequireJS.
- [yammy]({{ HOME_PATH }}projects/yammy/): an indent-based syntax for nice and
  clean templates of HTML pages. It also uses CSS-like selectors to define HTML
  tags.
