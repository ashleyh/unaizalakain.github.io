You unexpectedly arrived at my home, welcome!

I am Unai, a free and opensource software developer, an amateur hiker and
openstreetmapper when AFK, a yoyoer and pianist in my spare time and an admirer
of maths and physics. I am 22 years old and have been into software development
for my last five years.  Python has been my love since then and has lead me to
develop and collaborate on very interesting software projects.

After several gap years, I finally decided to continue studying. Although I am
currently living in the Basque Country, I will move to Scotland next year to
attend my software engineering classes.
